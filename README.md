Kotlin Repositories


The application UI/UX could be improved by adding a local database such as Room and saved at on the database 
all visited repositories with the option to delete any visited repository. 

The application architecture could be improved by adding a local data source to the ViewModel's repository and
creating a mapper class to map the object that we get from the server and mapping to an entity 
that we're displaying on the UI.

TO DO:

Design and implent an application using the GitHub API following the next steps:
  1. Log in with the Github API;
  2. Display a list of top kotlin repositories;
  3. Allow the user to select a repository;
  4. Display relevant stats about the selected repository.
  
  
Fetching data using Retrofit - Type-safe HTTP library
Implementing Koin dependency injection - dependency injection used in conjunction with Kotlin
Using MVVM architecture - is a part of clean architecture
Glide - image library

Libraries:

Koin
Retrofit
Glide
Android databinding
Affolestad Material Dialog
Support design libraries

The most challenging part into an application which fetching data is always the API.
The testing strategy could be improved by adding more tests.
